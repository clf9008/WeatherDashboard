# WeatherDashboard

A weather application that shows the current and future conditions for any city that is searched for in the input. The application will display current condition, future conditions, as well as the UV index. It will use the OpenWeather API and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

## Application Description

A user will enter a city into the search function (the city name or 'City, State',) then the application will speak with the servers at the OpenWeather API to get the current and future weather conditions. The application will display the temperature, humidity, UV index, and a dynamically rendered picture that shows the current weather conditions in real time (ie; Sunny and Clear, Thunderstorms, windy, etc.) Additionally, the application will display the forcast for the next 5 day's for the given city. 

The application will save all of the previously stored searches in local storage and will display these searches if the window is closed and opened again. To clear these searches, the will be a clear history button that allows the user to clear the local storage and dashboard if they'd like too.
